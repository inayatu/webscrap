The apparatus includes a circular disk with a lines corresponding to the declination angle of the earth with respect to the sun at particular dates of the year. The apparatus also includes arcs on the circular disk which correspond to the earth s rotation at particular times of the day. The circular disk can also have a slot to facilitate insertion of a pencil or pen time therein. The circular disk is substantially transparent to enable a user to lay the disk over a scaled figure and make calculations and measurements corresponding to a shadow to be estimated. Also disclosed is a method for estimating a shadow for a structure depicted in a scaled figure. The circular disk is placed over the scaled figure such that the slot in the disk is aligned with an azimuth of the sun so as to trace a shadow line. The circular disk is then reoriented perpendicular to the shadow line so that a scaled height line may be traced. The circular disk is then relocated so that the center of the slot is located at the end of the scaled height line. The circular disk is then rotated to an angle corresponding to the height of the sun and a projection line is traced in the slot from the end of the scaled height line to the shadow line. In this manner  the length of the shadow for a given azimuth and altitude can be determined.US Patent Number: 6 449 854UNIVERSAL HELIODON-SUNDIALAn apparatus for use with a source of light including a first orientation device that includes a latitude scale  a latitude pointer rotatable about a first axis relative to the latitude scale  and a platform configured to support an architectural model.

Faculty of Medicine,Orthopaedics and Traumatology,SHAPE MEMORY LOCKING DEVICE FOR ORTHOPAEDIC IMPLANTSNew!A mechanism to connect the supporting portions of orthopaedic implants such as in the head  spine  upper limb and lower limb and thereby prevent loosening and fretting at the implant interface of an orthopaedic implant construct has been developed based on shape memory effect and super-elasticity of shape memory materials such as nickel-titanium (nitinol or NiTi) shape-memory-alloy  without the use of typical threaded fastening technique. Advantages are conferred by making the entire device  not just connecting pieces  out of shape memory alloy and having shape memory effect and super-elasticity. Heating the memory head of the device will compress the connection portion without the use of an auxiliary device (e.g. coupling member) so that the connection portion can be completely clamped down by the memory head. Further advantages are provided through the use of a two-way shape memory effect in which the memory device can be closed or tightened by heating up the ambient temperature  and re-opened by cooling down the temperature.US Patent Number: 8 444 682PRC Patent Number: ZL200780033640.0INTERVERTEBRAL DISC TRANSPLANT AND IMPLANTATION METHODNew!A natural spinal disk including adjacent vertebral structures is removed from a deceased donor  rinsed in normal saline  preserved in a cryopreservative solution  and then frozen by gradually decreasing the temperature using liquid nitrogen or similar method.

The invention employs the superelasticity or pseudoelasticity  such as found in a nickel-titanium alloy  to provide a continuous  predictable  and controllable correction force and to achieve a gradual and full correction. The correction force can be exerted on the deformed spine either at the time of the spine surgery or after the surgery or both  to afford a full or substantially full correction. The continuous and controllable correction force of the present invention is safer than an instantaneous and large correction force applied only at the time of surgery. Additionally  the continuous and controllable correction force is capable of gradually and fully correcting the spinal deformities without any post-operative manipulation of the correction device or re-operation.US Patent Number: 7 976 568PRC Patent Number: ZL03824606.6PROSTHETIC DEVICE AND METHOD FOR TOTAL JOINT REPLACEMENT IN SMALL JOINT ARTHROPLASTYThe prosthesis device can have a pair of articular members adapted to be mounted onto adjoining bones  respectively  to replace a joint.
