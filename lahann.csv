Electrohydrodynamic Co-Jetting of Particles and Fibers ,BackgroundElectrohydrodynamic (EHD) co-jetting is a process developed in the Lahann lab for creating anisotropic microto nanometer-sized particles and fibers for use in the next generation of ‘smart’ devices. While standard technologies focus mainly on manipulating particle size and shape  EHD co-jetting explores the newest frontier of particle technologies by not only allowing control over particle size and shape  but also over the distribution of matter within the particles it generates. This enables desired chemical and physical properties to be compartmentalized in a single designer particle. Introducing multiple compartments with different chemical functionalities on a single particle can be employed to maximize particle function  utility  and efficacy. ,Technology In  short   EHD  co-jetting  is  an  economical   scalable   and  robust technique for producing polymeric particles or fibers  with  various  compartments.  This  is  achieved  by  pumping  two  polymer  solutions  through  parallel  capillaries  at  a  laminar flow rate. Upon application of a large electric field   the  fluid  expelled  from  the  capillaries  gets  stretched  and  thinned  as  it  accelerates towards  a  grounded  electrode.  During  this  stretching  process   the  solvents  readily  evaporate  out  of  the  polymer  solution  leaving  only micro-to-nanometer  scale  Janus particles  on  the  grounded  electrode.  Due  to  the  laminar  flow  rate  of  the  solutions   three   four   or  even  more  distinct  compartments  can  be  obtained by using  the corresponding number of capillaries  running in  parallel. By  controlling various  parameters  such  as applied electric field  polymer concentration  flow rates   viscosity  and conductivity  a large variety of particle shapes   sizes  and  surface  features  can  be  achieved.  At  the  proper  polymer  concentrations  and  viscosities   continuous  jets  of  anisotropic  polymer  fibers  can also  be attained   opening a  whole  new  range  of  potential  applications  for  EHD  co-jetting.Advantages • Simple instrumentation at low cost• Adaptable to a wide range of materials • Flexibility in particle shapes and morphologies • Controllable  particle  size over  several  orders  of  magnitude • Scalable  ,There is a wide range of applications for particles and fibers generated using EHD co-jetting. Particles (A) and fibers (B) equipped with multiple compartments with independent surface and bulk chemistries could be implemented in such fields as drug delivery and theranostics  tissue engineering  stimuli responsive materials  multiplexed bioassays  smart displays  and colorants. Select examples of such technologies are given below. Spatially controlled cell adhesion  where cells can be selectively adhered to only one compartment of a fiber  has been demonstrated on fibers fabricated using EHD co-jetting. Such a technology may have major implications in the field of tissue engineering and 3D cell culture. Novel shape-shifting particles capable of responding to physiological cues have been developed as delivery vehicles for genetic material. Additionally  other bioactive molecules  multiple therapeutics  and imaging agents can be incorporated into the particles. This enables multiple release kinetics from the same particle  as well as the ability to image the particles within cells and animals. Multicompartmental microcylinders with appropriately designed compartments can undergo defined shape reconfiguration  such as shape-shifting (A and B)  bending (C and D)  or toggling (D). An interesting aspect of these multicompartmental microcylinders is that compartments can be made of different polymers   which selectively respond to a specific stimulus. If multicompartmental microcylinders are exposed to ultrasound as the external stimulus  irreversible one-way shape-shifting can lead  to reconfiguration into near perfect spheres (A). Two-way  reversible shape transitions require multicompartmental microcylinders that are comprised of stimulus-responsive as well as inert compartments (C). If the compartments of the microcylinders are  however  composed of a hydrogel and an organogel  the individual compartments display different swelling responses. This can give rise to fully reversible three-way shape-toggling with well-defined convex-to-concave transitions (D). The controlled reconfiguration of multicompartmental microcylinders constitutes important steps towards the biomimetic development of adaptive materials with potential applications as sensors  actuators  or switchable drug delivery carriers.

Vapor-Based Reactive Polymeric Coatings ,BackgroundSurface modification of complex substrates has emerged as a key challenge in many applications. In this respect  vaporbased polymer coatings have garnered a lot attention as compared to wet-chemical approaches and are applicable to a diverse range of polymerizations. However  these coatings have been hampered by the lack of anchor groups and reactive functionalities for further surface modification.TechnologyWe have developed a novel vapor-based surface modification technique using chemical vapor deposition polymerization. This deposition process creates a layer of ultra-thin reactive polymeric film onto the substrates surfaces. The reacting coatings are made of poly-p-xyxlene containing functional anchor moieties. The deposition process does not require the use of any solvents/initiators  making it a bio-compatible process for various biomedical applications. The coating typically has a thickness in the nm to μm range and can be applied to any surfaces and to complex 3-dimensional geometries. Our custom-built CVD system has also enabled us to create polymer coatings which present multiple functional groups simultaneously  as well as polymer gradients. We have further demonstrated the applicability of these coatings towards biomimetic and spatially-directed surface engineering. ,Advantages • Solvent-free  • Room-temperature process • Good adhesion on a wide range of substrates • Yields pinhole-free conformal coatings • Provides chemically reactive functional groups • Applicable to 3-D and complex geometries Applications  • Covalent immobilization of ligands  • Click chemistry • Nanoimprint lithography • Surfaces with chemical gradients • Dry-adhesion bonding • Biomedical device coatings (stents  grafts  scaffolds) • Microfluidic device coatings • Implantable electronic device coatings • Cell culture substrates • Non-fouling surfaces • Nano-composites • Initiator coatings for ATRP  etc.     ,J.

Polymer Brushes for Biomedical Applications ,Background Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have a host of applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. In spite of the large therapeutic impact of stem cells  their use is hindered in part by the inability to maintain cells in long-term culture in synthetic environments. Currently  long-term hPSC culture requires an abundance of undefined factors including natural- and animal-derived products. The inclusion of such products results in immunogenicity concerns and inhibits clinical adoption.  ,Technology We  recently  identified  a  synthetic  polymer   poly[2- (methacryloyloxy)ethyl  dimethyl-(3-sulfopropyl)ammonium  hydroxide]  (PMEDSAH)  capable  of  sustaining  long-term  human embryonic stem cell (hESC) culture. This zwitterionic  hydrogel  is  created  via  surface-initiated  graft  polymerization.  Specifically   free  radicals  are  created  on  tissue  culture  polystyrene  (TCPS)  dishes  by  UV  ozone  plasma treatment. The dishes are placed in an oxygen free  reaction  vessel  along  with  the  MEDSAH  monomer  and  solvent  and  the  polymerization  reaction  proceeds  for  2.5  hours  at  ~76-82°C  (Figure  1).  hESCs  were  grown  for  longterm  passage  (passage#  ≥20)  in  both  defined  media  and  media void of animal products.Advantages over Naturally-Derived Matrices  • No batch to batch variation • No immunogenic concerns • Compatible with multiple cell lines/types • Compatible with common sterilization techniques Applications • Tissue engineering/regenerative medicine • Mechanistic cell or biomaterial studies ,
